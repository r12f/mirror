An auxiliary tool for Win32 GUI development.

This is a old tool that I created on 2012 for helping me doing win32 GUI development. Although it never got maintained after I left the team, but it is a really wonderful memory to me. Hence, saving it here.

For more details, feel free to check my old blogs from April to May in 2012:
